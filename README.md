# Global Job Market Mapper
### Problem Statement
For recent university graduates and career changers in the UK the transition into the professional world is often complicated by a lack of transparent real-time data. The main issue is that it is often unclear how much a specific technical skill (Python vs. SQL) contributes to a total compensation package. There is no streamlined tool that allows a user to input their current skill set and receive an immediate estimate of their market value. The Global Job Market Mapper aims to transform raw job market data into actionable career insights. The final output will enable users to make data-backed decisions about their professional development and salary negotiations.
